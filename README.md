# Artificial-Intelligence
All the codes (in C++) that  I have written to implement the concepts that I learnt of/in Artificial Intelligence

The following are the various codes included in the repository with a brief description about them:

1)A* Algorithm
A* is a computer science algorithm that is widely used in path finding and graph traversal. A* is an informed search algorithm or a best first search, meaning that it is formulatednin terms of weighted graphs. Starting from a specific node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given node having the smallest cost.

2)Bread First Search
Breadth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

3)Depth First Search
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

4)Depth Limited Search
Traditional depth first search could be deemed useless in infinite state spaces as they will continue to traverse down the leftmost branch infinitely. This essentially means that the path to the goal node might never be found, in order to combat this we can add a limit to the depth that our search recurses down the tree, this essentially transforms our depth first algorithm into a depth-limited algorithm.

5)Hill Climbing Search
Hill climbing is a mathematical optimization heuristic method used for solving computationally challenging problems that have multiple solutions. It is an iterative method belonging to the local search family which starts with a random solution and then iteratively improves that solution one element at a time until it arrives at a more or less optimized solution.

6)Neural Networks
An artificial neuron network (ANN) is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows through the network affects the structure of the ANN because a neural network changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output.

7)Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

8)Water Jug Problem
You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug . Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don’t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d is less than n.
